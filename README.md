# independentstudy
Fall Semester 2021 Independent Study Project

ISPart1.ipynb, ISPart2.ipynb, ISPart3.ipynb are the Jupyter Notebooks that I used throughout my project. These are the main Python files with markdowns to show my process. These are the most interesting files.

sttester.py is the web app that I made using my models and the Streamlit library. I could not use a Jupyter notebook due to file issues so it is a traditional Python file instead.

The CSV files are the various data tables that I saved throughout the Independent Study. bigstdata.csv and stdata.csv are the files that hold the final data for the 2018-2020 seasons and the 2021 season respectively.

I saved each of my 15 models using Joblib, and each Joblib file is a model that I created.
